From the HoTT book:

Exercise 2.11. A (homotopy) commutative square
P
h
/
k

A
f

B
g
/C
consists of functions f , g, h, and k as shown, together with a path f â—¦ h = g â—¦ k. Note that
this is exactly an element of the pullback (P â†’ A) Ã—Pâ†’C (P â†’ B) as defined in (2.15.11). A
commutative square is called a (homotopy) pullback square if for any X, the induced map
(X â†’ P) â†’ (X â†’ A) Ã—(Xâ†’C)
(X â†’ B)
is an equivalence. Prove that the pullback P :â‰¡ A Ã—C B defined in (2.15.11) is the corner of a
pullback square.

Exercise 2.12. Suppose given two commutative squares
A /

C /

E

B /D /F
and suppose that the right-hand square is a pullback square. Prove that the left-hand square is a
pullback square if and only if the outer rectangle is a pullback square.
